# E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the E-Commerce Website project! This web application allows users to browse,and purchase a variety of gadgets, including laptops, smartphones, iPhones, and MacBooks. 

## React Fundamental Concepts that I used in the project

This project utilizes several fundamental concepts of React, including:

1. **Components**: The application is structured with reusable functional components, including product cards, navigation bars, and modals.
2. **Props**: Data is passed between components using props to ensure that each component receives the necessary information.
3. **State Management**: Local component state is managed using the `useState` hook, allowing for dynamic updates based on user interactions.
4. **Effects**: The `useEffect` hook is used for side effects, such as fetching data and managing component lifecycle events.
5. **Routing**: React Router is utilized for navigation between different pages of the application, such as Home, Statistics, and Product Details.
6. **Conditional Rendering**: The app conditionally renders UI elements based on user actions (e.g., showing a modal or a notification).
7. **Forms and Events**: The application includes form handling for user interactions and managing state through events.

## Data Handling and Management

In this project, data handling and management are achieved using:

- **Local Storage**: The application utilizes local storage to persist user preferences and cart items. This allows users to retain their cart and wishlist items even after a page refresh.
- **Context API**: The Context API can be implemented in the future to manage global state across the application, improving the data flow and reducing the need for prop drilling.

## Features

Here are five key features of the E-Commerce Website:

1. **Product Browsing**: Users can view a  list of products categorized by type (laptops, smartphones, etc.), complete with images, descriptions, and prices.


2. **Wishlist Management**: Users can add products to their wishlist for future reference, with the ability to remove items easily.

3. **Cart Functionality**: Users can add products to their shopping cart and view the total price. The cart is managed in local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.thay can add the product also if they like and wnat to buy next time .

4. **Statistics**:User can see data of the mobile price and compare easity.

5. **Help Center**:User can see the FAQ section and get answer their some question that need.
